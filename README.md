# **Mensajeria La Reja - Uriarte - React**

[Github project Link](https://github.com/Kryosen/Idea-Uriarte-React.git)

## React based Project (ViteJs) for the online E-commerce of La Reja.

The idea of the project is a bit difficult to apply to a package delivery company. This is my family business, and trying to help them improve on sales, i got in mind to use my new skills to do an e-commerce page to promote the online interaction with the clients, including packs of deliveries that lowers the price per package depending of the amount of items in the pack (the more items in the pack, the lower the price per package). In the future, i am looking forward to add more variety of services to the clients depending on where they live, and where is the
package going to be delivered.
